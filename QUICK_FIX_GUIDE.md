# Quick Fix for Image & Video Generation

## The Problem

**Image Generation Issue:** BACKEND issue - missing dependency
**Video Generation:** Works for concepts, actual videos need special API access

## The Solution (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install OpenAI SDK
```bash
cd backend
pip install --upgrade openai
```

### Step 2: Configure API Key
Edit `backend/.env` and add:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
```

### Step 3: Restart Backend
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

## Test It Works

```bash
python test_image_video.py
```

Should see:
```
✓ IMAGE GENERATION SUCCESSFUL!
✓ VIDEO CONCEPT GENERATION SUCCESSFUL!
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## That's It!

**Images:** Now generate in HD (1024x1024)
**Videos:** Generate professional concepts with scene breakdowns

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check API key is correct (starts with `sk-`)
2. Verify OpenAI account has credits
3. Check backend logs for errors

See `IMAGE_VIDEO_ISSUE_RESOLVED.md` for detailed troubleshooting.
