## Verification Checklist

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Verify LangChain is installed
python -c "import langchain; print('LangChain OK')"
python -c "import langgraph; print('LangGraph OK')"
```

### Step 2: Environment Configuration

Check your `.env` file has:
```bash
# Required
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_url
DB_NAME=your_db_name
EMERGENT_LLM_KEY=your_emergent_key

# Optional (for LangChain supervisor)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key

# If OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, system falls back to standard agents
```

### Step 3: Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn server:app --reload --port 8000
```

Watch for these logs:
```
INFO: IntegratedSupervisor initialized with all agents and approval system
INFO: LangChain supervisor initialized successfully (if OPENAI_API_KEY is set)
INFO: Database initialization complete!
```

### Step 4: Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 5: Test Integration

#### Test 1: Basic Chat (No Approval)
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Type: "What can you do?"
3. Should get response without approval
```

#### Test 2: Complex Task (With Approval)
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Type: "Create a mail campaign for our product"
3. Should see "Approval Required" message
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/task-management
5. Should see the pending approval
6. Click "Approve"
7. Task executes
```

#### Test 3: Agent Communication
```
1. After completing Test 2
2. On Task Management page, check "Agent Communication" panel
3. Should see messages like:
   - "Supervisor -> ContentAgent: Creating email content..."
   - "ContentAgent -> EmailAgent: Content complete, sharing..."
   - etc.
```

#### Test 4: HD Image Generation
```
1. Type: "Create an image for Instagram"
2. Should generate HD 1024x1024 image
3. Check response includes:
   - image_base64
   - technical_specs with resolution
   - quality_validated: true
```

#### Test 5: Voice Approval
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/voice
2. Say: "Create a social media campaign"
3. Voice agent should ask for approval
4. Say: "Approve"
5. Navigate to task management automatically
```

## Testing with cURL

### Test Integrated Chat Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/integrated/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a mail campaign", "user_id": "test_user"}'
```

Expected response for approval:
```json
{
  "type": "approval_required",
  "status": "awaiting_approval",
  "approval_request": {
    "request_id": "...",
    "approval_type": "campaign_execution",
    "status": "pending"
  }
}
```

### Test Approval Endpoint
```bash
# Get pending approvals
curl http://localhost:8000/api/approvals/pending

# Approve a request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/approvals/{request_id}/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"notes": "Approved"}'
```

### Test Agent Communication
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/agent-communication
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "communication": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-01-26T...",
      "from": "Supervisor",
      "to": "ContentAgent",
      "type": "task_delegation",
      "message": "Creating email content..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## How Everything Connects

### Flow Diagram

```
User Request
     |
     v
[IntegratedSupervisor]
     |
     ├─> Is Complex Task?
     |    ├─> YES: Use LangChain Supervisor
     |    |    ├─> Delegate to multiple agents
     |    |    ├─> Agents communicate
     |    |    └─> Check if approval needed
     |    |         ├─> YES: Create approval request
     |    |         └─> NO: Return results
     |    |
     |    └─> NO: Use Standard Agent
     |         └─> Single agent execution
     |
     v
[Approval Required?]
     |
     ├─> YES: Store in approval_requests collection
     |    ├─> Show in Task Management UI
     |    ├─> User approves/rejects
     |    └─> Continue or cancel
     |
     └─> NO: Execute immediately
          └─> Return results
```

### Agent Communication Flow

```
1. User: "Create a mail campaign"

2. IntegratedSupervisor receives request
   └─> Determines it's complex

3. LangChain Supervisor analyzes
   └─> Creates subtasks:
       - Task 1: Create content (ContentAgent)
       - Task 2: Design campaign (EmailAgent)

4. ContentAgent executes
   └─> Logs: "Supervisor -> ContentAgent: Create content"
   └─> Logs: "ContentAgent: Creating engaging email content..."
   └─> Logs: "ContentAgent -> EmailAgent: Content ready, here's the messaging..."

5. EmailAgent executes
   └─> Logs: "EmailAgent: Received content from ContentAgent"
   └─> Logs: "EmailAgent: Designing 3-email sequence..."

6. Supervisor aggregates results
   └─> Checks: Approval required? YES
   └─> Creates approval request

7. User sees approval in Task Management
   └─> Reviews details
   └─> Clicks "Approve"

8. System executes approved tasks
   └─> Returns final results
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: LangChain supervisor not initializing

**Symptoms:**
```
WARNING: LangChain supervisor not available
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if OpenAI key is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# If not set, add to .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

# Restart server
```

**Note:** System still works without LangChain, using standard agents.

### Issue: Approval requests not showing

**Symptoms:**
- Task executes without approval
- Task Management page is empty

**Check:**
1. Is the task complex enough to require approval?
2. Check logs: `grep "approval" backend_logs.txt`
3. Check database: `db.approval_requests.find()`

**Solution:**
Complex tasks (campaigns, multiple agents) automatically require approval.

### Issue: Agent communication not visible

**Symptoms:**
- Agent Communication panel is empty

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:8000/api/agent-communication

# If empty, make a request first
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/integrated/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create campaign"}'

# Then check again
```

### Issue: Images not HD quality

**Symptoms:**
- Low resolution images
- File size < 100KB

**Solution:**
- Ensure using HDImageAgent, not ImageGenerationAgent
- Check `backend/agents/integrated_supervisor.py` line 156
- Should route to "HDImageAgent" for image requests
